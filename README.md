# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
This analysis project provides a comprehensive analysis and overview of the seven schools present in the district. Key metrics for school evaluation, such as grade, average scores, budget, student size and school type will be utilized to study the variable brackets and its relation to students' academic success.

## Results
To start with, we cleaned student names and got rid of prefixes as well as suffixes that are not relevant. These included: 
- Dr.
- Mr. / Mrs. / Miss
- MD / DDS / DVM / PhD

This did not impact the data. However, taking into account the potentially large impact of academic dishonesty due to the alteration of Thomas High School's math and reading scores for the 9th grade population, this analysis has nulled their records when calculating the remainder of the student-school statistics.
